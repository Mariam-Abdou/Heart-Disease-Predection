# Heart Disease Prediction

### Project Objectives
- Perform **exploratory data analysis** to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.
- Build **machine learning models** for predicting heart failure risk, including:
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
- Utilize **hierarchical clustering** to visualize relationships between patient groups with a dendrogram.

### Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle inconsistencies and ensure quality input for modeling.
2. **Visualization**: Employing graphs and charts to highlight key insights from the data.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Comparing multiple classifiers to determine the most effective approach for risk prediction.
5. **Clustering Analysis**: Providing additional insights by examining natural groupings within the patient data.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing heart failure data, blending statistical analysis with machine learning to support early diagnosis and effective risk stratification.
